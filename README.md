# EDvice

## Introduction

In an era where engagement is crucial for effective learning, traditional methods often fall short in capturing students’ interest. With the growing influence of gamification across various fields, there's an exciting opportunity to revolutionize education. Our project, EDvice, aims to transform learning into an interactive experience by integrating game mechanics with academic content. By creating a gamified learning platform, we strive to motivate students and make learning enjoyable.

## Objectives and Key Features

EDvice isn’t just another project—it’s a platform that turns learning into a fun, interactive adventure. Here’s how we’ve redefined education:

- **Subject-based Exploration:** 
  - **Vibrant Cities:** Subjects are transformed into immersive cities within an expansive world. Each city represents a different academic topic, allowing students to explore and interact with various learning environments.

- **Final Assessments, Leaderboards, and Rewards:**
  - **Final Boss Test:** At the end of each subject's journey, students face a final assessment to test their knowledge. Successfully completing these tests earns rankings and certifications.
  - **Leaderboards:** Track progress and compare performance with peers to foster a sense of achievement and friendly competition.

- **Enhanced Learning Experience:**
  - **Augmented Reality:** View and interact with 3D models related to the subject matter, enriching the educational experience and providing a hands-on learning approach.
  - **Chatbot Integration:** A finely-tuned chatbot provides real-time guidance and content generation, making the platform more interactive and accessible. The chatbot assists with queries, offers hints, and helps generate content related to the subjects.
  - **Document Translation:** Ensures global accessibility by translating educational content into multiple languages, making the platform inclusive for learners from different linguistic backgrounds.


## Tools and Technologies

- **Unity:** For game development and creating interactive 3D environments.
- **Flutter & Dart:** For developing the Android application.
- **Python:** For various scripting and automation tasks.
- **Git:** Version control system for managing code changes.
